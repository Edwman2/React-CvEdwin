          Hi! My name is Edwin, and since September 1, 2024, I've been studying
          to become a full-stack developer at Chas Academy. I first became
          interested in programming around 2017, but unfortunately, I didn't
          pursue it until now. It's been a lot of fun, but also challenging, to
          learn all the new concepts that come with programming, and I'm excited
          to keep improving. <br />
          <br />
          I'm a very social person who loves meeting new people and learning new
          things. Sometimes, this can get in my way because I tend to say yes to
          more things than I can handle. However, it has also been beneficial,
          as I've had the opportunity to learn a lot of new skills and meet many
          inspiring people along the way. <br />
          <br />
          Right now, I spend three days a week in Arboga, my hometown, because
          of my part-time job as a salesperson at a company called Telways. The
          other four days, I stay in Stockholm to attend school. It has been a
          bit of a challenge to balance everything, but so far, it's been going
          well. However, i'm now looking for a job in Stockholm so I can stay
          there full-time.
